            <main id="what">EVE Echoes is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) based off of EVE Online. 
                Echoes takes the EVE formula and starmap and adjusts it for mobile devices. 
                Fly and fight across the thousands of star systems or join a corporation and stake your own claim, but beware that you'll soon have to defend your turf. 
                If combat isn't your preference, you can also trade with other players in a completely player-driven economy. 
                Mine asteroids for materials to make your own ships or modules, or pay others to do it for you. 
                And if player versus player (PvP) isn't your style, there's plenty of player versus environment (PvE) content, pitting you against computer controlled enemies.
                <br><br>
                EVE is entirely player driven. Players buy, sell, create and destroy items and ships in the player-run economy. Players organize into corporations and alliances to 
                protect, fight and war over territories. The largest battles in EVE have thousands of players fighting at once. EVE Echoes is a bit smaller, but has already seen 
                fleet engagements of hundreds of players.
                <br><br>
                There are three kinds of space in EVE: highsec, lowsec and nullsec. In highsec you're safe from other players, but in low and nullsec you could be attacked. 
                Why leave highsec then? Lowsec and nullsec both have valuable resources and stronger and more valuable NPCs to fight. High risk means high reward.

            <main id="ships">
                There are dozens of ships to fly in EVE, from tiny frigates to massive battleships. Each ship has its role, with frigates excelling in quick hit and run tactics,
                as well as pinning other ships down, while battleships can unleash huge volleys from dozens of kilometers away. What ship you fly is up to you, as you learn and develop skills you can excel
                at any ship.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Frigates</strong> are the quickest and nimblest of all ships. They often engage in what's called "speed tanking," where your ship flies so quickly, it simply can't be hit by other ships.
                Frigates are the most fragile of the ships, so not getting hit is in your best interest. While not putting out the most damage, frigates demand an active, engaging play style that's a lot of fun.<br>
                <strong>Destroyers</strong> are anti-frigate platforms as well as utility ships. Tougher than frigates, they can take a few hits before going down. Enjoy hitting other ships from long range with 
                one of the 'sniper' destroyers, or stop foes in their tracks with an interdictor. <br>
                <strong>Cruisers</strong> are a flexible class of ships, suitable for a variety of purposes. There are more cruisers than any other type of class, fitting their inherent flexibility. If you want 
                to guard other ships, brawl up close with enemy fleets, support and heal other ships, target enemy ships for destruction, or even move stealthily behind enemy lines, there is a cruiser for you.<br>
                <strong>Battlecruisers</strong> trade some flexibility for damage. Bulkier and slower than cruisers, battlecruisers are nevertheless fearsome fighters as they deal tremendous amounts of damage, and 
                take it too. <br>
                <strong>Battleships</strong> are slow and pondering, but incredibly tough to take down and incredibly deadly in a fight. Not to be underestimated, fleets have to be organized to counter a well-equipped
                battleship.

            <main id="who">
                [BEST] is the unofficial "reddit" corporation. Organized originally on reddit.com/r/echoes, it has grown to include dozens of players from all over the world. Day or night,
                members play and engage in the wider Vendetta alliance to protect our own corner of space. We might not be the biggest corporation out there, but we're tenacious and won't give
                up.

            <main id="where">Welcome to nullsec: the lawless frontier of EVE Echoes. I won't make any silly comparisons to the Wild West. Here's it's kill or be killed. Unless you have friends.
                That's where the corp comes in. People can band together to defend the space and use it for themselves, if they can keep it.
